# MuJetAnalysis Background Estimation
This instruction is divided into two sections. First section is dedicated to low mass regime (0.25-9GeV). The second section is for high mass regime (11-59GeV).

## Low mass
A data driven method is used to estimate the SM yield, which mostly come from QCD processes.

## High mass
A MC vs data comparison at the control region is used. Meanwhile, a sanity check is done with ABCD method, which is purely data-driven.
